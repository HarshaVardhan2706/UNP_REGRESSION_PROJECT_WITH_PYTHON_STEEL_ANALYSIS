# UNP_REGRESSION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_STEEL_ANALYSIS

As part of my analysis of industrial energy data, I conducted a detailed evaluation of energy consumption patterns in the steel industry using the STEEL_REGRESSION_DATASET. The dataset was analyzed to identify trends in power usage, COâ‚‚ emissions, and load types. Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were applied to predict energy consumption, with Random Forest giving the best results. The study provided insights into key factors influencing energy efficiency and helped me gain hands-on experience in predictive modeling and sustainable industrial optimization.
